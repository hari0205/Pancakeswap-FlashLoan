# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Warning 
This project may cause some issues with dependencies on your machine. Try running the test multiple times to see if you get the same error. If faced with same error. 

Run 
```shell
npx hardhat clean
```

and try again.
